Jose Magana -- Zappos.Code() Application
========================================

I created my Zappos.Code() Application as one website experience. All projects are accessible  through links in the Zappos Application Home Page. 

## INSTRUCTIONS

*** NOTE ***
The BONUS (THE SEQUEL) project uses a MySQL database and two projects (Ninja Bookshelf and BONUS (THE SEQUEL) use PHP so all the files should be uploaded to your local server.

1. Place the"josemagana_zapposcode" folder on your local server
1. Create a database with with the todo_list.sql file located in: josemagana_zapposcode/todo_list_database/todo_list.sql
1. Configure the db.php file to connect the database located in: josemagana_zapposcode/to_do_list/_/includes/db.php (current settings are db name: todo_list, localHost:8889)
1. Open the index.html file in your browser: josemagana_zapposcode/index.html
1. That's it! Click through my projects.

Thank You!
