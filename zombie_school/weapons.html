				<p>Choosing a the best zombie weapons can be tricky. Although zombies are "human like" some effective human vs human weapons just won't do the job. Remember, zombies are already dead, half dead at least so you need more than just a little knife to do the trick. You will need two types of weapons: a close range weapon and a long range weapon. Choose weapons that cause the most damage from a safe distance. Check out our best and worst weapons pick below.</p>

				</div>
				<!-- <img src="_/img/weapons.jpg" alt="Anti-Zombie Weapons"> -->
				<p>Want to kick some zombie ass? Here we list our top short range and long range weapons for your survival :</p>
				<div class="long-box-list">
					<h3 class="subtitle">1. The Assalt Rifle</h3>
					<p>Assalt Rifles are awesome for killing zombies from a distance. You can set up camp on top of a building and secure the perimeter from long range. </p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">2. The Fire Bomb</h3>
					<p>Fire bombs are very easy to make. Fill a glass bottle with gasoline or 100 proof alcohol, attach a piece of dry cloth to it, light and throw and you have yourself a flame bomb! These make great distractions when you're off scouting for valuables. </p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">3. The Shotgun</h3>
					<p>The shotgun is the best short range fire arm you can find. It's great to fire into a large group of zombies. But don't go trigger happy, the shotgun takes time to reload. </p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">4. The Baseball Bat</h3>
					<p>The aluminum baseball bat is the best short range, non-lethal weapon around. Sure this might not kill a zombie but it might buy you some time to escape when you're short on ammo.</p>

			<section class="long-box">
				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">AssKicked Weapons</h2>
				</div>
				<p>You want to get your ass kicked by a zombie and become one of the walking dead? Didn't think so. Avoid using these weapons :</p>
				<div class="long-box-list">
					<h3 class="subtitle">1. The Pocket Knife</h3>
					<p>Pocket knives can do some major damage to human beings but zombies are not human beings! Knifing a zombie will only irritate him and cause him to eat you faster. By the time you knife him he'll have a chunk of your arm in his mouth.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">2. The Pepper Spray</h3>
					<p>If knifing a zombies only irritates them, what do you think pepper spray will do? If anything pepper spray will make you a little tastier.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">3. The Taser</h3>
					<p>Taser's might stall a zombie for a few seconds but they won't hurt them one bit. Plus, chances are you won't have a steady power source to charge it daily. And again, all it will do is motivate them to eat you faster!</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">4. The .22 Rifle/Gun</h3>
					<p>A .22 caliber bullet is a joke to zombies. You might as well shoot them with a BB gun. These guns might be common and ammo might be plentiful but you'll need a whole box to kill the dead.</p>

					<h2 class="section-header">You Need Ammo</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Guns are must have weapons for survival but if you run out of ammo all you have is a large rock. Make sure to stock up on as much ammo as you can afford. Learn how to store it properly for long-term storage to ensure it's reliability. Also, buy common caliber ammo even if you don't have a gun for it. You can use it to barter or you might even get lucky and find a gun for it.</p>

			<section class="long-box">
				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">Master Your Weapons</h2>
				</div>
				<p>So now that you have the guns and ammo, you're set, right? Wrong. What good is a gun you don't know how to use? If it jammed would you be able to fix it? What if you only have one bullet left and a zombie is dangerously close, is your aim good enough to deliver a one shot kill? You need to master your weapons in order to maintain them properly and to improve your accuracy.</p>
