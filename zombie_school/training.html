				<p>Survivor Man? Don't I just need to know how to shoot a zombie and find a great hide out? No, there's a lot more to surviving a zombie apocalypse than just being able to shoot and barricading yourself in a building. What happens when your food resources dry out? What happens when you run out of matches for cooking and heating? There are 5 basic needs for survival: food, water, shelter, fire, and security. Start training yourself for various difficult scenarios in case one day you're stuck in one of them.</p>

				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">Basic Survival Needs</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Knowing your basic survival needs can be the difference between life and zombie half-deadness. Learn these basic survival needs and prioritize accordingly:</p>
				<div class="long-box-list">
					<h3 class="subtitle">1. Water</h3>
					<p>You can only go about 3 days without water so making sure you have a natural supply nearby is key in basic survival. Learn how to treat water to avoid catching a deadly bug or even worse catching the zombie virus.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">2. Food</h3>
					<p>You can go a couple weeks without food but if you don't keep yourself well fed, you won't have the energy to fight off zombies. Learn how to store food for long-term storage. Stock up on non-perishable food and keep it in a safe location. Learning how to hunt and properly clean animals can also come in handy when food is scarce.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">3. Shelter</h3>
					<p>Shelter is particularly important in a zombie situation. You can have a ton of food and water but if zombies can get to you, you might as well have nothing. Take the time to scout your local area and pick a few locations to call home when the time comes. It's important to pick a location that provides you these 5 basic needs.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">4. Fire</h3>
					<p>Fire? I know this sounds a little primitive. Who worries about fire these days? But, you have to imagine yourself in a world infested by zombies. There won't be electricity, which means no running water, and no gas heating. You will need fire to boil water, keep yourself from freezing, and of course toast some zombies. Learn the primitive  ways of making fire and practice them often.</p>
					<h3 class="subtitle">5. Security</h3>
					<p>Security goes hand in hand with shelter but it's not so much as know how to barricade a house, you should know how to build defense mechanisms, alarms, traps and so on. Combat training and fire arms training is also part of security.</p>

				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">Physical Training</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Making sure you are in the best physical shape will greatly improve your odds of surviving. What if you need to out run a mob of quick zombies? Would you be able to run long distance if you need to or will you be exhausted after running around the block? You also need to be strong enough to fight off the bigger zombies. Get off your butt, lift some weights and do some cardio. You'll thank us later.</p>

			<section class="long-box">
				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">Mental Training</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Are you prepared to possibly be alone with monsters roaming the streets? Are you prepared to see nightmare causing zombie gore? It's important to stay mentally sharp. The last thing you want to do is lose it and jeopardize the lives of your fellow survivors. Watch as many zombie movies as you possibly can and envision yourself in their situations. What would you do? How would you feel? Doing that will better prepare you for the big day.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="long-box">
				<div class="red-header-box">
					<h2 class="section-header">Medical Training</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Medical training is very important. What if you accidentally cut yourself? In the unsanitary world of zombies even the smallest of cuts can be deadly. Learn how to keep wounds clean, even how to stitch up a wound if you need to. You will have no hospitals to go to when you are badly injured. In a world of zombies, you are the doctor.</p>

				</div>
				<p>We know planning for zombies isn't easy. Where and how do you start? Well, we put together a collection of great resources to help ease the pain. Find out what books, movies, websites, and stores will help you survive.</p>

					<h2 class="section-header long-header"><a href="weapons.html">Weapons 101 &raquo;</a></h2>
				</div>
				<p>Choosing a the best zombie weapons can be tricky. Although zombies are "human like" some effective human vs human weapons just won't do the job. Remember, zombies are already dead, half dead at least so you need more than just a little knife to do the trick.</p>
